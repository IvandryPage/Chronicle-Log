Chronicle Log
===============

Chronicle Log is a **basic** journaling application. <br>
But wait, even though it's a **basic** journal, but it keeps your journal a little bit private for non-hacker guy.

This is how you use it: 

> You need to input your journal category name in order to open it. And this application, doesn't have your category list by itself. You need to create it by yourself; relying on yourself.'
>> I know it's not smart enough, but i'm sorry for inconvenience. This is the best I can do right now.
